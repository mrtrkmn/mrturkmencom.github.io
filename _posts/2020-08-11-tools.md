I wanted to note down some tools (-applications-) which I found useful and use in daily routines.  It will be updated time to time whenever a new tool is used or discovered . 

- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) - Cyberduck is a libre server and cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows with support for FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure & OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox. 
  
- [Notable](https://notable.app/) - The Markdown-based note-taking app that does not suck. (I searched for markdown supported cloud based solution however could not find any in my request)

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - The Free & Open Source Image Editor. This is the official website of the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)

- [KEKA](https://www.keka.io/en/) - the macOS file archiver ; Store more, share with privacy

The list could be extended in some more additional tools which are programming based tools. In general, I prefer to have complete IDE instead of code editors, however in some cases code editors are very usseful as well. For operations on terminal, I prefer to use  [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) which is very powerful text editor. 

No matter which programming language, I will use, I prefer to use JetBrains Professional tools could be found at [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) page.

As code editor, I have different options which are ; 

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose

- [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editing. Redefined. (More powerful than simple text editor)

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - The Collaboration Platform for API Development. (I use it time to time and it is super useful for API development as well.)

- [GitKraken Pro](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - Legendary Git client for Windows, Mac & Linux. Free for open source. (I use pro version which is NOT free however it is quite comfortable both pro and free version, especially when you have conflicts at merging stage)
