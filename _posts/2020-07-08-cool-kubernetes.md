# Cool Kubernetes  ðŸ¤“

It is a place which contains valuable resources about Kubernetes. It is somehow similar to awesome projects on Github, the logic is same however approach is different, instead of creating pure readme.md file like [here](https://github.com/irazasyed/awesome-cloudflare#readme), I am generating and publishing all stuff using Github Pages. Another important difference is that, this project does not only contain links to outsource, it also contains valuable information regarding to Kuberntes which is collected from variety of sources. For instance, let's say someone is registered to Kubernetes or Kubernetes related course and realized that some figures, graphs or piece of information is valuable then that information could be added this resource hub. 
Many of you might say that "Well, you are duplicating existing information out there", it is correct however, having most of valuable information from a place, which you know already, will save a lot of time for you.

For time being [2020-07-08], the site does not contain lots of resources, however in time, it will contain troubleshooting techniques and approaches on Kubernetes. Even more, guides to "How to contribute an open soucce project which focuses on Kubernetes ?" could  be discussed depends on demand.  

The project is open source as any other awesome lists project on Github, it means that the project is open to contribution as well, if you would like to add/improve/issue something on this resource hub. That's perfect, do changes and creat pull request or drop an issue ðŸ˜‰

I do not know whether it will be persistent or not, however I will try to update it occasionally.
